Steps for settings a Git repo with Github:
# create a repo to host a new project on GitHub
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "And so, it begins."
    hub create # → (creates a new GitHub repository with the name of the current directory)
    git push -u origin HEAD


Example Steps for getting an existing repo:
# clone your own project
hub clone dotfiles
→ git clone git://github.com/YOUR_USER/dotfiles.git

# clone another project
hub clone github/hub
→ git clone git://github.com/github/hub.git

# fast-forward all local branches to match the latest state on the remote
cd myproject
hub sync

# list latest open issues in the current repository
hub issue --limit 10

# open the current project's issues page
hub browse -- issues
→ open https://github.com/github/hub/issues

hub browse rbenv/ruby-build wiki
→ open https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build/wiki
